# Group_03 - Q2
###### This Project is still developing, check back later for updates! 
Web-based app implementing ideas borrowed from "Eleven Habbits of Highly Effective People". Basically, tasks are divided into four quadrants
  Q1, upper left -> Important and Urgent (creating PPT for tomorrow's presentation)
  Q2, upper right-> Importan but not Urgent (prepare SOP for graduate school applications)
  Q3, lower right -> Neither Important nor Urgent (watch newest episode of your favorite TV show)
  Q4, lower left -> Urgent but not Important (do laundry)
The general ideas is, while priorizing scheduling urgent tasks such that none goes overdue, schedule the non-urgent tasks in between the urgent ones, such that the non-urgent tasks do not become urgent with time. Importancy of tasks are the most weighted metric for breaking ties within urgent and non-urgent sub-groups.
